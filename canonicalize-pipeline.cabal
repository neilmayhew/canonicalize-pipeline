synopsis:           Canonicalize a Concourse pipeline file
description:        Adjust a Concourse pipeline file to a standard form so that
                    it can be compared against other pipeline files (including
                    the YAML that was used to define it originally) without
                    noise from differences that aren't semantically meaningful
                    (eg list ordering).
